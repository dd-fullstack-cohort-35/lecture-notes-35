# 1st Day Lecture

## Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp: let's break it down
- Developer
    - Question: What does it mean to be a developer?
    - To make something
    - Making things work properly
    - Improve something
    - 
    - A person who writes applications in computer code.
    - This is you!  Right now!  You belong here.
    - Attributes
        - Problem solving
        - Attention to detail
        - Creative
        - Tenacity
        - Solutions
        - Teamwork
        - Empathy
    - Developer is not the only career path coming out of this bootcamp, just the most common
        - project manager
        - technical recruiter
        - designer
        - UI/UX specialist
        - business analyst
- Web - Writing for the browser.
    - Question: Which devices run browsers?
        - Laptops/desktops
        - Phones
          -Tablets
        - Screen readers
        - Cars
        - APIs
        - More
- Fullstack - Facile with both front-end and back-end development
    - https://twitter.com/bluecoders/status/966624401172123649
    - **front-end** - how the page looks and behaves
        - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related technologies
        - Not the same as a designer!
    - **back-end** - transforming data between human-readable and machine-readable formats
        - **Database** - where our data is stored
        - back-end language (PHP, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, many others)
- Bootcamp - 10 week intensive course
    - Expect homework
        - Almost 2/3 of our students report doing more than 10 hours per week outside of class.
        - Last three weeks are especially intense
    - We treat this like a professional environment, not a classroom
        - Accountability: first you, then peers, then instructors.
        - No personal attacks, rudeness, mocking, condescension, or other toxic interpersonal behavior.
    - Bring your whole self
        - Mental, emotional, and physical.
        - Transparency!  If we know what's going on, we can help.
        - Attendance and participation is mandatory - 50% of capstone

## Congratulations on completing the pre-work/passing the test
- The pre-work was a test of your ability to work through obstacles.
- It was a taste of what the bootcamp and the rest of your coding career will will be like...
- Coding and web development languages are changing constantly and fast
- So fast that it's a common occurrence to come across tutorials and instructions that will be out of date...
- ...like the ed25519 key type option in putty
- This can be frustrating, but it's a part of being a developer.
- If it was easy, everyone would do it, and it wouldn't pay as well.
- We may not help you when you run into these obstacles, if we think it will deprive you of the opportunity:
    - to develop your problem solving skills
    - to experience the satisfaction of solving the problem yourself
    - to develop a pattern of problem -> frustration -> experiment -> frustration -> research -> experiment -> frustration -> experiment -> solution -> celebrate!
- We will usually only step in and help if we see the time being spent dealing with an obstacle is taking time away from another more important learning experience.

## Classroom logistics
- Some terms we sometimes use
    - **TL;DR**: too long; didn't read.
- Zoom intro
    - breakout rooms
    - chat
    - we don't usually pay attention to nonverbal responses
        - don't use "raise hand", speak up instead
- Stand-up meetings: 15 minute meetings 8:00 a.m.
    - What you did (including tech work/events outside of class)
    - What you're going to do next
- Code alongs
    - twice a week
    - about an hour
    - make a github repo and push your code to it

# UI/UX and User-driven Design
## UI vs UX
-   **user interface**  (UI) - the graphical and interactive parts of an application that a user interacts with directly
    -   Buttons, links, visual layout, etc.
    -   limited to what's on the screen
    -   usually narrowly-focused
-   **user experience** (UX) - all aspects of an end-user's interactions with an application.
    -   includes everything in UI
    -   also includes back-end code, email interactions, social media
    -   all aspects of how a user uses your application
    -   We focus on UX, not just UI
-   Example: Bootcamp
    -   [ddc-web-student](https://ddc-web-student.cnm.edu/) is the User Interface
    -   admissions, lectures, projects, and graduation are all included in User Experience
    -   most examples for apps will be more narrow
-   Question: How do we stop thinking in terms of UI, and instead think in terms of UX?
## User-driven Design
-   ideal behavior of an application flows from the users of the site
    -   Pareto principle (80/20 rule) - 80% percent of the value of the site comes from 20% of its functionality
    -   focus on what users want to do the most
    -   this is called  **user-driven design**
### Personas
**user persona** - an idealized user of the site
-   best persona to build first is the ideal user for the site
-   all applications have at least one key persona, most have several
-   give them a personality, including:
    -   name
    -   technology
        -   device(s)
        -   proficiency
        -   do they love or hate it?
    -   attitudes & needs
        -   Why are they using your site?
        -   What need does this persona have that your application aims to fill?
        -   Why choose your site over other options?
    -   Anything else that is specifically relevant to your application
-   Match these personas to a role, like Power User, Admin, First-time Visitor, Casual User, etc.
-   Example:  [https://dribbble.com/shots/3052941-UX-Persona-for-Book-App](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdribbble.com%2Fshots%2F3052941-UX-Persona-for-Book-App)
-   Class exercise: Let's come up with a user profile for an idealized Twitter user
### User Stories
**user story**  - one sentence statement of what a user will do
-   "as a _____ user, I want to ____"
    -   imagine each user story in the first person narrated by the persona
-   Bite size
    -   should be no more than 20 words
    -   should revolve around no more than 3 pages/modals on the site
-   Examples
    -   As a power user, I want to suspend an abusive account
    -   As a registered user, I want to reserve a seat
    -   As a support user, I want to comment on a help ticket
    -   As an anonymous user, I want to search nearby events

-   Question: What are some user stories for Twitter?
### Use Cases & Interaction Flow
User han5olo has posted Star Wars in a Star Trek forum. Admin Dora is monitoring abuse reports at work and is inundated with complaints about the excessive Star Wars posts from han5olo. Knowing what an inferior franchise Star Wars is, Dora is determined to rid the world wide web of these posts! \  
![:engage:](https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T053NFY3R/engage/60a35fd8f81e3b12.jpg) \
precondition: Dora is logged into her administrative level account

postcondition: han5olo is banned from making further posts.

1.  Dora clicks a complaint to take action against
2.  The site presents the complaint to Dora
3.  Dora clicks on suspend user
4.  The site asks for confirmation to suspend the account
5.  Dora clicks yes to confirm the action
6.  The site disables the unreasonable troll's account

Class Activity: YouTube Exercise:
* Split the class in half
* Assign one group to come up with a Persona, Use-case, and Interaction-flow for a YouTube user who is a content creator.
* Assign the other group to  come up with a Persona, Use-case, and Interaction-flow for a YouTube user is a content consumer.
* Both groups present

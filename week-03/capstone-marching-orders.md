# Capstone Marching Orders
## Pre-Data Design Tasks
1. Share phone numbers in your group channel
2. Create a Github Organization to own the Capstone
   - https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch
   - add teammates to the organization
   - add the bridge as collaborators to the capstone repo
3. discuss your vision and goals for this capstone
   - submit your vision and goals for approval
   - the one and ONLY item that's informal
## Data Design Tasks   
1. Once Vision and goals have been approved, gain access to asana and create Sprint1 tickets.  
2. Once all necessary tickets are created, put all files related to data design a new directory, `documentation`
   - in `index.html`, make a landing page with some sort of navigation that's easy to use (no need to be a front end genius like @rm -rf /)
   - create one file per persona and name them adrien.html, chris.html, ...
   - put the user stories and use case/interaction flow in the persona file
   - put the conceptual model in concept-model.html
   - put a one paragraph executive summary in index.html
   - Create wireframes for what you envision your capstone will look like and add them to /documentation/wireframes
      - If you hand-draw your wireframes they must be of high quality and scanned.

## Cutting down scope - Blood on the Floor
Instructors will be very pointed and downright brutal on cutting features that will likely cause too much work/problems/overcomplications etc
a lot of times you can keep a "dream list" of what you want to do after graduation

# Planning Poker Exercise
Your team runs a painting business for home interiors. A client wants to hire your team to paint their
home. They want an estimate for the total number of person-hours it will take for the home.
1. Create a deck of cards with the values ?, 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, and ∞.
2. Break down the house into tasks.
3. For each task, play [planning poker](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker) until your team comes to an agreement about how long it will
   take. If it takes longer than 8 hours, split it into smaller tasks.
4. When you're done estimating tasks, come up with a total amount of hours. Write a brief summary
   of what your group came up with and post it in the cohort channel. The summary should contain
    1. The total time you estimated for the project
    2. What your tasks were, and how much you estimated for each
    3. Any assumptions you made about the tasks you estimated.

## Details about the project:
- The house is a 3 bedroom, 2 bath, 2000 square foot house.
- You will have to paint every room in the house.
- You do not have to paint the exterior.
- The client is currently living in the house, so furniture, etc. is present in the house.
- The client has not specified paint color, texture, or anything else, but told you to "make it look nice."
- All tasks should take 8 hours or (preferably) less. You are calculating in total person-hours (e.g. 2 painters x 4 hours = 8 hours).

As you're doing the project, think about how you choose to break up the project, how you assign the
work, and how you manage to come to consensus around how long things will take. After the exercise
is over, talk with your group members about how you can take the lessons from this and move forward
with them in your group

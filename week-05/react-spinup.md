### Technologies we use as part of the React stack
- Node.js - allows us to use javascript on the server, outside of the browser
- npm - Node Package Manager - grabs node libraries and installs them on our computer
    - We need this in order to install Create React App
    - npx - the script executing tool for npm
- Babel - takes new JS syntax and automatically backports it to format that works cross-browser
    - Devs can write in new format, and don't have to worry about backwards compatibility
- Webpack - takes all of your JavaScript and "compiles" it into smaller files and uses only what you need
    - Also finds changes in your application and automatically compiles and deploy them
- Create React App - an all-in-one server application that spins-up React applications so that we can easily test them.

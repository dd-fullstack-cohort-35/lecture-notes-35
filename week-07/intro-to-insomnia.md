# Intro to Insomnia

## What is Insomnia?
* the software we use to test our APIs
    * we use this software to mimic requests that our front-end will make
    * we can't build our dynamic React front-end until the back-end is ready
* Insomnia has some handy features
    * save your requests individually so you can come back to them later
    * much easier than trying to debug in the browser
* where to get it: https://insomnia.rest/download
    * download and install Insomnia core

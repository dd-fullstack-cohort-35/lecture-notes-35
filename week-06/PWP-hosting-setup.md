# PWP Hosting Setup Codealong
### Create a new project and droplet on Digital Ocean
- Create project - New Project in sidebar
    - projects are a way of organizing droplets
    - names and descriptions should be relevant for you, e.g. gkephart-bootcamp
- Create -> Droplet
    - Marketplace -> Docker on Ubuntu (choose latest versions)
    - Basic plan
    - $5 per month
    - San Francisco 2
    - IPv6 and Monitoring
    - New SSH Key (copy/paste your ssh key from your computer)
        - Mac/Linux key location: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        - Windows key location: PuTTYgen
    - Choose hostname (internal to docker, e.g. george-pwp)
    - backups are strongly encouraged
    - Wait for process to finish
    - Copy the IP address for later

### Disable root ssh access
- we do this for security
    - root ssh access means that if login is compromised, entire server is compromised
    - better way: ssh in as a different user, then use sudo to run commands as root
    - means that if attacker gets our key, they don't have full access unless they ALSO get our password
- ssh into the server
    - For Mac and Linux: `ssh root@104.248.64.22`
    - For Windows: Set up a new PuTTY session
        - **Session**
            - Hostname: droplet ipv4 address
            - name `pwp`
            - Click `Save`
        - **Connection → Data**
            - Auto-login Username: root
        - **Connection → SSH → Auth**
            - Private key file for authentication: *Browse to the ssh-key.ppk file in your bootcamp directory*
        - **Session**
            - Click pwp
            - Click Save
- create user
    - `useradd -c "George Kephart" -m -s /bin/bash -g users -G sudo gkephart`
    - replace George's name and username with your own
- create password
    - `passwd gkephart`
- Move .ssh key file
    - `cp -r .ssh /home/gkephart`
- change ownership of the .ssh directory
    - `cd /home/gkephart`
    - `chown gkephart:users .ssh/`
    - `chown gkephart:users .ssh/authorized_keys`
- Test Changes
    - `exit`
    - Mac/Linux: `ssh gkephart@104.248.64.22`
    - Windows:
        - **Session**
            - Click pwp
            - Click Load
        - **Connection → Data**
            - Auto-login Username: change from root to gkephart
        - **Session**
            - Click pwp
            - Click Save
- // **if successful**, delete the root user
    - Don't do this while logged in as root!
    - `sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER`
    - `sudo rm -rf /root/.ssh`

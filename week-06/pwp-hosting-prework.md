# PWP Hosting Setup Prework
You will need to do some preliminary preparation before we start the PWP class lecture series.  Be sure to do this at least 24 hours in advance of the PWP Hosting Seupt lecture, as you may need to contact Digital Ocean support to iron out account verification issues.

## Gift Cards
- We use gift cards to give you $ for hosting and domain name set up.
- Because past participants have had difficulties with verification, we suggest that you do NOT use this card on your account, and instead use a different personal form of payment.
    - Gift cards are often used by scammers because they are harder to trace.  This means that Digital Ocean, Paypal, etc. are pickier about accepting them.
- Our gift cards are issued by Bank of America and can be used like ordinary credit cards.
    - We will bring a form around for you to sign.  This signs off liability for the gift card to you and acknowledges receipt of the card.
    - Instructors and students will both verify that numbers match envelope to signoff sheet.


## What you need to do
### 1. Activate your gift card and optionally link it to Paypal
- Authenticate card using the URL on the letter OR phone verification
    - Add your address on the card.  This will help when you are asked to verify the card, and is required if you choose to link your card.
    - We suggest doing this at home, as a whole lot of verifications coming from the same IP address or location can be flagged by credit card companies as suspicious.
- Go to PayPal and add the gift card as a method of payment

### 2. Buy a domain
- Any place you can buy a domain is fine, but our suggested domain registrar is Namecheap
    - Simple
    - Inexpensive
    - Digital Ocean has good doc for it
- You may use a domain you have already purchased if you wish

### 3. Sign up for Digital Ocean and validate your account
- create an account and login to Digital Ocean
    - Use our affiliate link and you'll get some free credit: https://deepdivecoding.com/hosting/
- Digital Ocean may ask you to validate your account by
    - taking a picture of yourself
    - uploading your ID
    - purchasing an initial credit
    - **If you get the account locked message, contact Digital Ocean support and say that you are taking a coding bootcamp and spinning up a small personal website.  They will usually unlock you within 24 hours.**
    - If you still can't get their attention, try pinging them on Twitter.
- We suggest using PayPal for payment.  This allows you to purchase credits, and can eliminate surprise overages.
